# Critiquing Data Visualizations

## 1. The Least Affordable Cities in America

<https://priceonomics.com/most-and-least-affordable-places-to-buy-a-home/>

**What's Good?**

-   The visualization in a basic list format makes the data accessible and easy to understand.
-   The organization from least to most is an easy way to quickly see the cities that are not affordable.

**What can be improved:**

-   Of the top 50 least affordable cities, only 7 are not in California. To really drive this point home, I think a density map visualizing the most vs. least affordable areas would be more impactful.

## 2. Average Number of Marriages per Day

**What's Good?**

-   With this chart you can very quickly see that the summer months are by far the most popular times to get married.
-   It's an interesting way to visualize outlier trends (*for example, you can quickly gather that outside of the summer months, Valentines Day is a popular time to get married, while Christmas is avoided*)

**What can be improved:**

-   The color hue choice is not intuitive. Instead, opting for a color saturation scale (*ex. light blue to dark blue*) might make a bit more sense.
-   There is no way to quickly visualize weekend vs. weekday trends. Perhaps that needs to be a different graph entirely, but it would be interesting information.

## 3. Data Skills Needed in the Coming Years

*In this example, I'm specifically looking at the "Least Affordable Places to Buy a Home in America" table.*

**What's Good?**

*This graph very clearly shows how valuable specific data skills are, and the differing responses between each one.* This graph is concise and does well at highlighting specific aspects of data skills for more detailed insights.

**What can be improved:**

-   It is unclear what each row's skill is referring to (*skills vs success metrics?, etc.*)
-   It is an extremely generalized visualization, and would be more valuable if it charted valuable data skills per industry.

## 4. Largest US Cities Ranked by 2022 Crime Rates

<https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1dbzkgj/oc_largest_us_cities_ranked_by_2022_crime_rates/>

**What's Good?**

-   The color hue differentiation between violent crime vs. property crime is useful in visualizing a difference in the amount of each type of crime.
-   The stacked bar chart quickly displays differences in crimes within a given city.

**What can be improved:**

-   The stacked bar chart makes it difficult to communicate crime rate trends between differing cities. A line chart would more easily communicate this information.
-   I almost feel as if this is trying to contain/communicate too much information at once. Utilizing multiple charts to show differences in crime types, specific crimes, and between different cities would be useful.
