## Making Numbers

"parse" strings into numbers

```{r}
x <- c("1.2", "5.6", "1e3")
parse_double(x)

```

```{r}
x <- c("$1,234", "USD 3,513", "59%")
parse_number(x)
```

## Counts

```{r}
flights |> 
  count(dest)

#to see most common values (largest groups)
flights |> 
  count(dest, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r}
flights |> 
  group_by(dest) |> 
  summarise(
    n = n(), 
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

n_distinct()

```{r}
flights |> 
  group_by(dest) |> 
  summarise(carriers = n_distinct(carrier)) |> 
  arrange(desc(carriers))
```

```{r}
flights |> 
  group_by(tailnum) |> 
  summarise(miles = sum(distance))

#weighted counts
flights |> 
  count(tailnum, wt = distance)

flights |> 
  count(tailnum)
```

```{r}
flights |> 
  group_by(dest) |> 
  summarise(n_cancelled = sum(is.na(dep_time)))
```

### Exercises

1.  How can you use [`count()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/count.html) to count the number of rows with a missing value for a given variable?

```{r}
flights |> 
  count(is.na(dep_delay))
```

2.  Expand the following calls to [`count()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/count.html) to instead use [`group_by()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html), [`summarize()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html), and [`arrange()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/arrange.html):

<!-- -->

1.  `flights |> count(dest, sort = TRUE)`

2.  `flights |> count(tailnum, wt = distance)`

```{r}
flights |> 
  count(dest, sort = TRUE)

flights |> 
  group_by(dest) |> 
  summarise(
    n = n()
  ) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

```{r}
flights |> 
  count(tailnum, wt = distance)

flights |> 
  group_by(tailnum) |> 
  summarise(
    n = sum(distance)
  )
```

## Numeric Transformations

R recycles, or repeats, the short vector

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 10, 20)
x / 5
```

```{r}
x * c(1, 2)
x * c(1, 2, 3)
```

```{r}
flights |> 
  filter(month == c(1, 2))
```

Max / Min\
pmin() and pmax()

```{r}
df <- tribble(
  ~x, ~y,
  1, 3,
  5, 2,
  7, NA,
)

df |> 
  mutate(
    min = pmin(x, y, na.rm = TRUE),
    max = pmax(x, y, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

In R, %/% does integer division, %% computes remainder

```{r}
1:10 %/% 3 #integer division

1:10 %% 3 #remainder
```

```{r}
flights |> 
  mutate(
    hour = sched_dep_time %/% 100,
    minute = sched_dep_time %% 100,
    .keep = "used"
  )
```

```{r}
flights |> 
  group_by(hour = sched_dep_time %/% 100) |> 
  summarise(prop_cancelled = mean(is.na(dep_time)), n = n()) |> 
  filter(hour > 1) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = prop_cancelled)) +
  geom_line(color = "grey50") +
  geom_point(aes(size = n)) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x = "Scheduled departure hour",
    y = "proportion of cancelled flights"
  )
```

```{r}
round(123.456)

round(123.456, 2) #two digits
round(123.456, 1) #one digit
round(123.456, -1) #nearest ten
round(123.456, -2) #nearest hundred
```

```{r}
round(c(1.5, 2.5))
#Banker's rounding - when half way between 2 integers, rounds to nearest even integer

x <- 123.456
floor(x)
ceiling(x)

#round down to nearest 2 digits
floor(x / 0.01) * 0.01

#round up to nearest 2 digits
ceiling(x / 0.01) * 0.01

#round to nearest multiple of 4
round(x / 4) * 4

#round to nearest 0.25
round(x / 0.25) * 0.25
```

#### Cutting numbers into ranges

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20)
cut(x, breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20))
cut(x, breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 100))


cut(x,
    breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20),
    labels = c("sm", "md", "lg", "xl"))
```

```{r}
x <- 1:10
cumsum(x)
```

### Exercises

1.  Explain in words what each line of the code used to generate [Figure 13.1](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/numbers#fig-prop-cancelled) does.

```{r}
flights |> 
  group_by(hour = sched_dep_time %/% 100) |> 
  summarize(prop_cancelled = mean(is.na(dep_time)), n = n()) |> 
  filter(hour > 1) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = prop_cancelled)) +
  geom_line(color = "grey50") + 
  geom_point(aes(size = n))
```

group_by(hour = sched_dep_time %/% 100)\
groups data by the hour of scheduled departure time (extracting hour portion of the time)

summarize(prop_cancelled = mean(is.na(dep_time)), n = n())\
summarizes grouped data by calculating the proportion of canceled flights for each hour\

2.  What trigonometric functions does R provide? Guess some names and look up the documentation. Do they use degrees or radians?

sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), asin(x), acos(x), atan(x), sinh(x), cosh(x), tanh(x), etc. All trig functions in R use radians, not degrees.

3.  Currently `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time` are convenient to look at, but hard to compute with because they’re not really continuous numbers. You can see the basic problem by running the code below: there’s a gap between each hour.

```{r}
flights |> 
  filter(month == 1, day == 1)

flights |> 
  filter(month == 1, day == 1) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = sched_dep_time, y = dep_delay)) +
  geom_point()
```

Convert them to a more truthful representation of time (either fractional hours or minutes since midnight).

```{r}
????
```

4.  Round `dep_time` and `arr_time` to the nearest five minutes.

```{r}
flights |> 
  mutate(
    dep_time = round(dep_time / 5) * 5
  )
```

## General Transformations

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 2, 3, 4, NA)
min_rank(x)
min_rank(desc(x))
```

```{r}
df <- tibble(x = x)
df |> 
  mutate(row_number = row_number(x),
         dense_rank = dense_rank(x),
         perfent_rank = percent_rank(x),
         cume_dist = cume_dist(x))
```

```{r}
df <- tibble(id = 1:10)

df |> 
  mutate(
    row0 = row_number() - 1,
    three_groups = row0 %% 3,
    three_in_each_group = row0 %/% 3
  )
```

Offsets

```{r}
x <- c(2, 5, 11, 19, 35)
lag(x)
lead(x)

#difference between current and previous value
x - lag(x)

##current value changes
x == lag(x)
```

Consecutive identifiers

```{r}
events <- tibble(
  time = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 20, 27, 28, 30)
)

events <- events |> 
  mutate(
    diff = time - lag(time, default = first(time)),
    has_gap = diff >= 5
  )

events |> 
  mutate(
    group = cumsum(has_gap)
  )
```

### Exercises

1.  Find the 10 most delayed flights using a ranking function. How do you want to handle ties? Carefully read the documentation for [`min_rank()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/row_number.html).

```{r}
flights |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(dep_delay))) |>
  filter(rank <= 10) |> 
  arrange(rank) |> 
  select(flight, dep_delay, rank)

flights |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(dep_delay)) |>
  filter(rank <= 10) |> 
  arrange(rank) |> 
  select(flight, dep_delay, rank)
```

2.  Which plane (`tailnum`) has the worst on-time record?

```{r}
flights |> 
  group_by(tailnum) |> 
  summarise(avg_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            n_flights = n()) |> 
  filter(n_flights > 20) |> 
  arrange(desc(avg_arr_delay))
```

3.  What time of day should you fly if you want to avoid delays as much as possible?

```{r}

```

4.  What does `flights |> group_by(dest) |> filter(row_number() < 4)` do? What does `flights |> group_by(dest) |> filter(row_number(dep_delay) < 4)` do?

```{r}
flights |> 
  group_by(dest) |> 
  filter(row_number() < 4)

flights |> 
  group_by(dest) |> 
  filter(row_number(dep_delay) < 4)
```

5.  For each destination, compute the total minutes of delay. For each flight, compute the proportion of the total delay for its destination.

```{r}

```

6.  Delays are typically temporally correlated: even once the problem that caused the initial delay has been resolved, later flights are delayed to allow earlier flights to leave. Using [`lag()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/lead-lag.html), explore how the average flight delay for an hour is related to the average delay for the previous hour.

```{r}
flights |> 
  mutate(hour = dep_time %/% 100) |> 
  group_by(year, month, day, hour) |> 
  summarize(
    dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |> 
  filter(n > 5)
```

7.  Look at each destination. Can you find flights that are suspiciously fast (i.e. flights that represent a potential data entry error)? Compute the air time of a flight relative to the shortest flight to that destination. Which flights were most delayed in the air?

```{r}

```

8.  Find all destinations that are flown by at least two carriers. Use those destinations to come up with a relative ranking of the carriers based on their performance for the same destination.

```{r}

```

## Numeric Summaries

use mean for symmetric distributions, median for skewed distributions

```{r}
flights |> 
  group_by(year, month, day) |> 
  summarize(
    mean = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    median = median(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n(),
    .group = "drop"
  ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = mean, y = median)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "white", linewidth = 2) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
flights |> 
  group_by(year, month, day) |> 
  summarize(
    max = max(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    q95 = quantile(dep_delay, 0.95, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  )
```

```{r}
flights |> 
  group_by(origin, dest) |> 
  summarise(
    distance_iqr = IQR(distance),
    n = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |> 
  filter(distance_iqr > 0)
```

```{r}
flights |> 
  filter(dep_delay < 120) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = dep_delay, group = interaction(day, month))) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 5, alpha = 1/5)
```

```{r}
flights |> 
  group_by(year, month, day) |> 
  summarise(
    first_dep = first(dep_time, na_rm = TRUE),
    fifth_dep = nth(dep_time, 5, na_rm = TRUE),
    last_dep = last(dep_time, na_rm = TRUE)
  )
```
