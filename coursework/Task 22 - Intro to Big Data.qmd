## Hadoop

Infastructure software for storing large datasets\
Batch processing environment\
Not good for adhoc quiries

**HDFS** (Hadoop Distributed File System) - cluster system\
allows you to store files larger (or more files) than what your PC can handle

**MapReduce** - processes data on nodes\
moves processing software to data, not other way around like normal

## Apache Spark

SparkSQL, Streaming, MCLib, MLLib, GraphX, SparkR, all supported by **Spark Core**

**RDD** - Resilient Distributed Dataset

Advantage? Very *speedy*! \
Disadvantage? Extreme amount of RAM needed
